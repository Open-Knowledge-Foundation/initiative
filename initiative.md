## Principles of the Open-Knowledge Foundation

The Open-Knowledge Foundation is built upon the vision of fostering decentralized, open-collaborative efforts among individuals, teams, and institutions within the scientific community (STEM) and across all domains of human knowledge. This includes:

1. **Science** (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology, etc.)
2. **Mathematics**
3. **Technology** (Software, Hardware, Design, etc.)
4. **Engineering** (Research and Implementation)
5. **Philosophy and Literature**
6. **History and Politics**
7. **Other Knowledge Domains**

The Foundation aims to address key challenges faced by traditional academic and research systems, such as:

1. The **lack of decentralization** and community-driven initiatives, without compromising rigor.
2. The **insufficient adoption of open-collaboration** methods, as exemplified in the open-source movement.
3. The **absence of platforms, software, and tools** that:

   * Raise awareness of collaborative methods.
   * Empower open collaboration through effective implementation.
   * Provide solutions or alternatives to the issues and models of traditional academia.

### Defining the Open-Knowledge Foundation

The term "Open-Knowledge Foundation" serves as an umbrella for individuals, teams, research groups, institutions, and universities who:

1. **Adhere to the principles of open-collaboration.**
2. **Recognize the power of open-collaborative methods** and decentralization, ensuring that scientific rigor is maintained.
3. Position their projects (or portions of them) as part of the open-knowledge ecosystem, making them accessible and usable by both Foundation members and the broader community.
4. Advocate for **freedom of knowledge**, **freedom of speech**, and **liberal values**, especially in the context of information and knowledge.

### What the Open-Knowledge Foundation Does Not Represent

The Foundation does not align with the following:

1. The concept of **free, invaluable information** without proper context or attribution.
2. Those who **oppose the principles of open-collaboration** or freedom of speech.
3. **Unscientific publications** (unless explicitly identified as unscientific literature) or **pseudo-scientific approaches**.

The Open-Knowledge Foundation is a **movement towards an open-collaborative future** for human-produced knowledge, grounded in decentralization, freedom of speech, and community-driven principles.


## Uniqueness of the Open-Knowledge Foundation

While there have been similar initiatives focused on open-knowledge, research, and scientific collaboration, the Open-Knowledge Foundation (OKF) distinguishes itself in several important ways. While these other foundations have made valuable contributions in their own right, OKF addresses key limitations that often restrict broader engagement and impact:

1. **Inclusive Scope Across Knowledge Domains**
   Many of these initiatives focus on specific domains of human knowledge, such as science or technology. In contrast, the Open-Knowledge Foundation supports and advocates for **all forms of human-produced knowledge**, as long as they meet the definition of "knowledge." This inclusive approach enables cross-disciplinary collaboration, extending beyond traditional academic or professional boundaries.

2. **Flexibility in Implementation**
   While many foundations discuss open-knowledge principles and their implementation within a single context or project, the Open-Knowledge Foundation is **not a singular entity**. Rather, it serves as a **shell term** that can be applied to diverse projects, research groups, teams, or even individual initiatives. OKF provides the framework, resources, and support necessary to implement the principles of open collaboration, decentralization, and scientific rigor within various projects. It advocates for the adoption of these principles across a broad spectrum of work, helping quality initiatives within the community thrive.

3. **Tools, Platforms, and Support for Community Growth**
   The Open-Knowledge Foundation is committed to not only promoting these ideals but also **creating and offering platforms, software, and tools** designed to empower the community. These resources are intended to facilitate collaboration, improve accessibility, and advance the values at the core of the foundation. Through these innovations, OKF works to steer the community towards the shared vision of decentralization, freedom of knowledge, and open collaboration.

## Long-Term Goals of the Open-Knowledge Foundation

The Open-Knowledge Foundation (OKF) envisions a long-term future where it becomes a **standard approach in scientific research**—not as a replacement for traditional academia, but as a **companion** that complements and enhances academic efforts. The Foundation seeks to provide the community with the means to adopt a **free, open-collaborative approach** to scientific work, research, and academic endeavors, underpinned by shared values and principles that resonate across academic disciplines.

The Foundation is committed to addressing the following long-term challenges:

1. **Reforming Peer-Review and Scientific Validity Checks**
   One of the key issues in current academic systems is the reliance on centralized, monolithic peer-review processes and academic journals that often limit access and innovation. The Open-Knowledge Foundation seeks to transform this into a **dynamic, decentralized approach** that:

   * Holds the **entire community** accountable for the quality and integrity of its contributions.
   * Minimizes the influence of a small group of journals and academic elites, ensuring broader participation and transparency.

2. **Improving Platforms for Communication and Collaboration**
   Academia often lacks effective platforms and software that facilitate communication, collaboration, and the open exchange of ideas. The Open-Knowledge Foundation aims to fill this gap by providing **free, open-source software** designed to support collaborative scientific work. Funding for these initiatives will come from:

   * **Donations** from supporters and benefactors.
   * **Selling support services** to ensure sustainability.

   Despite generating revenue, all funds will be managed **transparently** and reinvested into the Foundation’s mission to further its vision.

3. **Providing Comprehensive Education**
   The Foundation strives to make **education accessible to all**, offering resources and opportunities from foundational to advanced subjects. This will ensure that individuals, regardless of background, can join and contribute to the community, enhancing knowledge accessibility across the globe.

4. **Empowering Individual Researchers and Educators**
   The Open-Knowledge Foundation seeks to empower **individual researchers** and **educators** by providing tools, resources, and platforms to support their work. By nurturing individual contributions, the Foundation fosters a more decentralized and inclusive research ecosystem.

5. **Advancing the Open-Knowledge "Market"**
   Knowledge is the currency of the modern world, and the Open-Knowledge Foundation is committed to enhancing the "market" for knowledge in a way that is **accessible and beneficial** to all. The Foundation seeks to create a **free-market approach** that:

   * Ensures producers of knowledge receive the recognition and benefits they deserve.
   * Encourages a **community-driven** environment where knowledge is shared freely, and the rewards are distributed equitably. This stands in contrast to the current issues with academic journals and commercial publishers, where the profits often do not benefit the producers of knowledge.

While the Foundation advocates for **open, community-driven models**, it also acknowledges the need for **fair compensation** and **recognition** for contributions, ensuring that the open knowledge ecosystem remains sustainable and valuable for all involved.
